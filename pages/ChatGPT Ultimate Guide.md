# **About the content**

Due to the ridiculous amount of ChatGPT capabilities, it took me a while to
figure out some sort of structure and outline for the book and its content.
Finally, I ended up with the version you are now looking at. Based on the
name of each chapter, you should have some idea of what it includes and
what kind of capabilities it covers.

The free part of this book up until and including chapter Document is
supposed to give ideas to as many people as possible on how to use ChatGPT.
Since I personally believe that it can improve life of virtually anyone
connected to the Internet.

The second part is then more focused on professionals to increase their
productivity, improve themselves and the work they do by using ChatGPT.
The second part also contains some interesting advanced concepts of how to
use ChatGPT including Attention Formulas for influencers and Role-Playing.

# **Important notes and limitations**

All chapters include as many various, creative and practical prompts as
possible to use with so called placeholders. That is [placeholder] for content
which you can then replace with your own. These are intuitive, it will say
[topic] or [genre] etc.

In case you don’t know, currently ChatGPT doesn’t have any knowledge of
events after 2021, so it is not able to always give you the most updated
information. That is the only reason why search engines are still in play
Anyway, you have to consider this fact everytime you work with ChatGPT.

Context is always important. It is actually in nature of how ChatGPT works, so
your prompts and output of ChatGPT will always depend on exactly each
word you provide. That is why designing proper prompts to get what you
want is important and even in that case bot may produce various results. So
one thing even more important than proper prompt, is a series of proper
prompts

Prompts in this book are ready to use, but most of all they are to inspire your
imagination and to get a handle on how to talk to ChatGPT for various
purposes.

Let’s go.
